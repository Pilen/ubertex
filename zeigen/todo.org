* DONE Find time format
  Right now a simple string is used.

* DONE Task manager
** DONE remove tasks that has been completed
** DONE fix TaskManager comparing with the string "now"
** DONE cpu use
   let it sleep until tasks been added
   use a condition variable with the run loop calling wait when there is nothing to be done
   let addTask call signal

   use await with a timeout
   when adding you might have to signal
** DONE Can only handle one task pr time!!!

* Proper error messages
* DONE PApplet
** DONE Use final to make methods uninheritable

** DONE decide which sketch to start

** DONE Creation
   Call super in constructor
   Store arguments

   setup call zsetup(args) that calls zsetup()
** DONE exiting
   call exit()
   overwrite exitActual so the entire program is not terminated.
* DONE Clearqueue should clear sketches queues too
* Exiting sketches should inform their controller
* Sketches should share taskqueues.
  Currently they have their own private taskqueues
  This means that when the sketch exits it closes all further sketch messages
  Should kill/close then clear the queue?
* fullscreen
** starting a sketch in fullscreen is wonky in xmonad
   Sometimes it starts as a floating window other times its a tiling.
   Nondeterministic
   A race-condition?
   adding a sleep 2000 between creating the sketch and calling it's zStart wont fix it
   try{Thread.sleep(2000);} catch (Exception e) {}

   This can be circumvented by either not using Xmonad or using Xmonad in fullscreen configuration
** White flash
   There is a small white flash when starting applications in fullscreen mode.
   It is not visible in normal mode.
* Awaiting should not wait for the same amount of time as next
  But how long then?
  Is it a problem?
* Escape kills the sketch closing the sketch terminates the program.
  Feature?
* NOTE ZSketch differences with processing
  Names
  color is not a datatype, it's an int!
  Don't use noLoop() (yet).


* IMPORTANT!!! zReceive is not called when noLoop is on
  We might want to overwrite noLoop in that case.
  Then the sketch taskmanager should be handled in its own thread
  Untill loop is called again.

* Start arguments
  It might be better to let the optional offsets be in the sketchname part instead of following arguments;
  aka
  "brok;now;start;Image 10 20;full;255 255 255"


* Because of the catch all, sketches wont get warned about checked exceptions.

* DONE Sketches
** DONE Image
*** ? Image loading in a separate thread
    Use requestImage instead.
    Might not be necessary
*** DONE start color might be better as a space separated list

* DONE Blank
  Draws the background color
  Needs Draw to overwrite the blanked.
  aka does not "store" the old image.
  what should happen to stored tasks?
  what should happen to incomming tasks

  When to wake up?
  on special signal?
  on new arrival?
  on task?


* hasName should probably be removed now

* Raceconditions between sketch and controller
  blank
  volatile?
  clearqueue


* NOTE sketch messages with blanked
  If you want to send the message "blanked" to the sketch you need to send it a sign of what to do about blankedness manually.
  Looks on the first argument to sketch if it is any of XXX it is an order about blankness else it is probably just a part of the message and passed on to zReceive.
  So if you want to send a message with a word from XXX, you must also specify an option manually.

* Image and PDF has an out ouf bounds in zReceive

* message to non running sketch nullpointerexception


* DONE make UTF-8 work!
  Or use some other encoding!
* start should be en try catch block.
* Fix video.jar
  Should not be distributed.
* Sketches start slow and then speeds up to normal speed.



* Ubertex
  cant have multiple \elisp in slides, even between pauses

`user' is the user on the location.
`location' is the location on the network including username and IP or hostname eg. revy@192.168.0.123 or revy@brok.
`port' is the listening port of zeigen on the worker. nil means the default is used.
`display' is the display the worker should display at, most likely :0 if it has only one display. nil means the default is used.
`dir' is the directory on the worker where all files for the revy are stored. nil means the default is used.
